# ALLinLan

“AllinLAN” is a java based desktop application where Private Chat, GroupChat,
FileSharing, Screen Sharing functionalities can be formed through LAN i.e Local Area 
Network.The working is divided between two Users, Secondary User which runs as a 
client and Primary User, which runs as the server in the network.
To start chatting, file sharing or screen presenting, the only thing which is required to 
the Secondary User is the IP address and Port Number of the Primary User. A Pc 
becomes a server (Primary User) by choosing start chat or send file or start server in 
the above provided functionalities.
In “AllinLAN” one can practice two kinds of chatting, public one (message is 
broadcasted to all connected users) and private one (between any 2 users only).
Advantage of using LAN in our project is that it can connect multiple devices without 
Internet Connection in one Network and it is also secure as data sent within the 
network cannot be accessible to the persons outside the network.
